            <h2 class="head">What is Git?</h2>
            <p>Git is a system which take care of when,who,what was done in the code
                basically a book keeping mechanism.
               It is free and open source distributed version control system.</p>

            <h2 class="head">How it Works?</h2>

            <p>You record the local chnges to your code using a cli tool or
                 using GUI(graphical user interface). When using Git,you make
                 changes to your code files normally as development process.
                When you have completed the coding or want some screenshots of 
                chnges ,add the file you chnged to a staging area and then
                 commit them to the version history of your project.</p>

                <p>Once you push the file it can be found in github.com as you
                    have named your repo.The default setting will be git push origin
                     master.This pushes your code to main branch of your repo.
                    
                    If any chnges happen to a repo that you wish to  pull from 
                    GitHub to local system,you simply use git pull to see the chnges</p>
